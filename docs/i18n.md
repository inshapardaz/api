# Internationalization

The API should support various types of natural languages. As an example an urdu ui should request the resource names to be in urdu where as the hindi ui should expect the names to be returned as hindi text.

Similarly, different scripts for different languages should be served based on client requirements.

All of this is driven through [Accepted-Language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language) header.
